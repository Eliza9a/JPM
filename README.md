Here is the Java project which I was asked to do in the first year. Go on the link above to see more about it.

For the Project Milestone, I decided to create a 2D platform game. 
This includes 5 levels, with different levels of difficulty.

- You need to control the character by pressing the arrow keys (to move left or right or to jump) and also
by pressing the "space" key to jump higher when needed. 

- To shoot press “shift”.

- To reach the next level, the player must collect all the coins and destroy the obstacles (where is the case) without hitting wrong.
You must be careful because the character can lose life if it touches any obstacle or enemy

- The player can collect an energy drink which will increase the life points. 

- Do not fall into the lava, otherwise the game will be over! 


Doing this project was a great opprotunity to learn java and object-oriented programming.
